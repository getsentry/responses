0.20.0
------

* Deprecate `responses.assert_all_requests_are_fired`, `responses.passthru_prefixes`, `responses.target`
  since they are not actual properties of the class instance.
  Use `responses.mock.assert_all_requests_are_fired`,
  `responses.mock.passthru_prefixes`, `responses.mock.target` instead.
* Fixed the issue when `reset()` method was called in not stopped mock. See #511

0.19.0
------

* Added a registry that provides more strict ordering based on the invocation index.
  See `responses.registries.OrderedRegistry`.
* Added shortcuts for each request method: delete, get, head, options, patch, post, put.
  For example, to add response for POST request you can use `responses.post()` instead
  of `responses.add(responses.POST)`.
* Prevent `responses.activate` decorator to leak, if wrapped function called from within another
  wrapped function. Also, allow calling of above mentioned chain. See #481 for more details.
* Expose `get_registry()` method of `RequestsMock` object. Replaces internal `_get_registry()`.
* `query_param_matcher` can now accept dictionaries with `int` and `float` values.
* Add support for the `loose` version of `query_param_matcher` via named argument `strict_match`.
* Added support for `async/await` functions.
* `response_callback` is no longer executed on exceptions raised by failed `Response`s
* Change logic of `_get_url_and_path` to comply with RFC 3986. Now URL match occurs by matching
  schema, authority and path, where path is terminated by the first question mark ("?") or
  number sign ("#") character, or by the end of the URI.
* An error is now raised when both `content_type` and `headers[content-type]` are provided as parameters.
* When a request isn't matched the passthru prefixes are now included in error messages.

0.18.0
------

* Dropped support of Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6
* Fixed issue with type annotation for `responses.activate` decorator. See #468
* Removed internal `_is_string` and `_ensure_str` functions
* Removed internal `_quote` from `test_responses.py`
* Removed internal `_matches` attribute of `RequestsMock` object.
* Generated decorator wrapper now uses stdlib features instead of strings and exec
* Fix issue when Deprecation Warning was raised with default arguments
  in `responses.add_callback` due to `match_querystring`. See #464

0.17.0
------

* This release is the last to support Python 2.7.
* Fixed issue when `response.iter_content` when `chunk_size=None` entered infinite loop
* Fixed issue when `passthru_prefixes` persisted across tests.
  Now `add_passthru` is valid only within a context manager or for a single function and
  cleared on exit
* Deprecate `match_querystring` argument in `Response` and `CallbackResponse`.
  Use `responses.matchers.query_param_matcher` or `responses.matchers.query_string_matcher`
* Added support for non-UTF-8 bytes in `responses.matchers.multipart_matcher`
* Added `responses.registries`. Now user can create custom registries to
  manipulate the order of responses in the match algorithm
  `responses.activate(registry=CustomRegistry)`
* Fixed issue with response match when requests were performed between adding responses with
  same URL. See Issue #212

0.16.0
------

* Fixed regression with `stream` parameter deprecation, requests.session() and cookie handling.
* Replaced adhoc URL parsing with `urllib.parse`.
* Added ``match`` parameter to ``add_callback`` method
* Added `responses.matchers.fragment_identifier_matcher`. This matcher allows you
  to match request URL fragment identifier.
* Improved test coverage.
* Fixed failing test in python 2.7 when `python-future` is also installed.

0.15.0
------

* Added `responses.PassthroughResponse` and
  `reponses.BaseResponse.passthrough`. These features make building passthrough
  responses more compatible with dynamcially generated response objects.
* Removed the unused ``_is_redirect()`` function from responses internals.
* Added `responses.matchers.request_kwargs_matcher`. This matcher allows you
  to match additional request arguments like `stream`.
* Added `responses.matchers.multipart_matcher`. This matcher allows you
  to match request body and headers for ``multipart/form-data`` data
* Added `responses.matchers.query_string_matcher`. This matcher allows you
  to match request query string, similar to `responses.matchers.query_param_matcher`.
* Added `responses.matchers.header_matcher()`. This matcher allows you to match
  request headers. By default only headers supplied to `header_matcher()` are checked.
  You can make header matching exhaustive by passing `strict_match=True` to `header_matcher()`.
* Changed all matchers output message in case of mismatch. Now message is aligned
  between Python2 and Python3 versions
* Deprecate ``stream`` argument in ``Response`` and ``CallbackResponse``
* Added Python 3.10 support

0.14.0
------

* Added `responses.matchers`.
* Moved `responses.json_params_matcher` to `responses.matchers.json_params_matcher`
* Moved `responses.urlencoded_params_matcher` to
  `responses.matchers.urlencoded_params_matcher`
* Added `responses.matchers.query_param_matcher`. This matcher allows you
  to match query strings with a dictionary.
* Added `auto_calculate_content_length` option to `responses.add()`. When
  enabled, this option will generate a `Content-Length` header
  based on the number of bytes in the response body.

0.13.4
------

* Improve typing support
* Use URLs with normalized hostnames when comparing URLs.

0.13.3
------

* Switch from Travis to GHA for deployment.

------

* Fixed incorrect type stubs for `add_callback`

0.13.1
------

* Fixed packages not containing type stubs.

0.13.0
------

* `responses.upsert()` was added. This method will `add()` a response if one
  has not already been registered for a URL, or `replace()` an existing
  response.
* `responses.registered()` was added. The method allows you to get a list of
  the currently registered responses. This formalizes the previously private
  `responses.mock._matches` method.
* A more useful `__repr__` has been added to `Response`.
* Error messages have been improved.

0.12.1
------

* `responses.urlencoded_params_matcher` and `responses.json_params_matcher` now
  accept None to match empty requests.
* Fixed imports to work with new `urllib3` versions.
* `request.params` now allows parameters to have multiple values for the same key.
* Improved ConnectionError messages.
